### 1. Jingang Yu, **Quankai Gao**. Graph Matching with Feedback, under review, 2019.<a href="https://zerg-overmind.github.io/files/FBGM.pdf" target="_blank">[PDF]</a>

* we propose a new approach to graph matching, called Graph Matching with Feedback (FBGM). Instead of pursuing single-shot optimization, FBGM bridges graph matching with conÔ¨Ådence measure to form a close-loop framework with feedback.
