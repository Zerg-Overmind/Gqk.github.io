I am currently a master student majoring computer vision at WHU. I am fortunate to be advised by [**Prof.Gui-Song Xia**](http://www.captain-whu.com/xia.html) in CAPTAIN group. Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in the school of Automation Science and Engineering, <a href="https://www.scut.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> South China University of Technology </a>in 2019.

I have a broad interest in the theory and applications of **Machine Learning** and **Optimization**.
