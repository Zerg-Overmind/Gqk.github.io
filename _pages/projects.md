### 1. Jingang Yu, **Quankai Gao**. Graph Matching with Feedback, under review, 2019.<a href="https://zerg-overmind.github.io/files/FBGM.pdf" target="_blank">[PDF]</a>

* we propose a new approach to graph matching, called Graph Matching with Feedback (FBGM). Instead of pursuing single-shot optimization, FBGM bridges graph matching with conÔ¨Ådence measure to form a close-loop framework with feedback.

### 2. **Quankai Gao**, Fudong Wang, Guisong Xia. Structure Guided Learning Graph Matching, under review, 2020.<a href="https://zerg-overmind.github.io/files/SGLGM.pdf" target="_blank">[PDF]</a>

* we treat the deep features of graph elements and graph structure jointly as important prior to guide the graph matching process. On the one hand, we do not use the deep features alone to match due to the feature alignment error, but combine the information of graph structure in an explicit way; on the other hand, the number of parameters in the training step has not increased.
